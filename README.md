### `npm i react-accessible-accordion`
The react-accessible-accordion package is a React component library that provides accessible accordion functionality. An accordion is a UI pattern that allows users to expand or collapse sections of content, usually organized in a list or panel format. This library offers a way to create accordions in React applications while ensuring accessibility for users with disabilities.

### `npm i react-select-async-paginate --force`
The react-select-async-paginate package is an extension or enhancement to the react-select library, which itself is a highly flexible and customizable dropdown/select component for React applications.
react-select-async-paginate specifically extends the capabilities of react-select by introducing asynchronous data loading with pagination support. It allows you to fetch options for the select dropdown asynchronously, enabling you to handle large datasets efficiently.
Using react-select-async-paginate allows developers to create select components that can handle large amounts of data fetched asynchronously, providing a smoother user experience while interacting with dropdowns that contain paginated data. The --force flag is used with npm i to forcefully reinstall or re-download the package, potentially resolving any installation or compatibility issues.



# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
